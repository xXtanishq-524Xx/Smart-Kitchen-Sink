 The IoT Based Smart Kitchen sink 
 
The IoT Based Smart Kitchen sink is a modern plumbing technology that incorporates various sensors and control systems to 
manage water usage more efficiently. One such smart sink is equipped with a pH sensor, solenoid valve, Arduino microcontroller, 
and soil moisture sensor to provide a comprehensive water management system. 

The pH sensor installed in the sink detects the pH level of the water, and the solenoid valve separates the water into either 
an acidic or alkaline stream based on the pH level. The system is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller that reads the pH 
level of the water and activates the solenoid valve to divert the water into the appropriate container. This process helps to 
reduce water waste and increase the reusability of water.

The smart sink also includes a soil moisture sensor that detects the moisture level in the soil. When the moisture level is low, 
the system activates a pump to release the stored alkaline water into the soil, providing a sustainable solution for watering plants 
and landscaping.

The benefits of a smart sink are numerous. It helps to reduce water waste and conserve water resources, contributing to sustainable 
living practices. Additionally, the system provides a more efficient way to manage water usage, which can lead to cost savings on 
water bills. The use of smart technology also reduces the need for manual intervention, making it a convenient and time-saving solution 
for households or other settings.
